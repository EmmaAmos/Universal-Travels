                                This is a simulator ride. Guests are given a quick preshow, where Gru explains a bit about the minion-ization process before being interupted by his three daughters. Once guests are let into the threate, each party will be seated into a motion similar veichle. For anyone who hates wareing 3D glasses, this ride doesn't have thouse! This ride does take place within a dark threater, however there's no external special effects besides the motion simulation. This ride is great for children who love the Minion franchise, however adults may find this ride underwhelming. Though, us inthe reporting room do love the dance party in the gift shop!

                                This ride is one of our favorites in the reporting room! This is a thrilling high-speed, roller-coaster ride. This ride does include special effects, flashing lights, and loud noises. Anyone who's sencitive to this should not ride. For thouse who don't heed the intern's warnings about the mummy's curse, a very thrilling ride awaits! At first, this ride starts out rather slow. The mummy reveals himself and tries to win our souls over with riches and even warns us about the torment we may face is we don't comply. We then run into the dreaded flesh-eating beetles from the movie. We are flung backward, running into the mummy once again before being whiped into the faster portion of the ride. Now, fair warning, to thouse of us who do get tricked by the flase exit, it's totaly fine! That's the best part of the ride! Us inthe reporting room find the false exit, and it's animatronic to be farily impressive.

                                This is another particular favorite in the reporting room, espcily for one of our reporters. "The Rockit", as we call it, is an outdoor coaster with a a steep drop, twists, turns, and amazing music! While music tastes do vary, in the reporting room, we find that the country catagiory syncs up with the ride the most. The other categories are club, pop, rap, and of course classic rock. Now, on your first go, it may be slightly uncomfortable as one of our reporters found out from experince. The lift hill is stright up and the seats are somewhat leaned back, which can lead to the sensation of you falling out of your seat. Also, as several of our reporters found, it's better to leave your glasses in the locker, since your bound to be flung around.

                            As much as we in the reporting room loved the mvoies, the ride is a huge let down! Thsi ride is a motion simulator that takes place on a "party bus." This ride is slow moving, with some external special effects, and lots of loud noises. The ride starts with two live preshows, which then take you to the loading area. After that, you get on a self-driving bus and move into the first of three simulation rooms. The bus itself is litly josseled to simulate the bus dirving. After a quick word from some of the movie cast, we then go into a back alley where we seen some cars reving up before then going tonthe secound simmulator room. It's here we arrive at a party, which the police then promptly shut down. After that, we come to the final simulator room. Here, we go on a simulated high speed chase, in which we get toss around. For anyone sitting nearest to the sides, our condolences, since you will be getting the brunt of the special effects. You'll be getting the fogg effect stright in the face, your right next to the loud speakers, and cloests to the screens, which can be disorienting with all the effects. One of our reports wishes there hwere seat belts inthis ride, since the bus will toss you into the poeple around you. My team an I where honestly surprized our first time on, since Fast and Furious is all abount speed. We where expecting more of a rollar coaster, and we're wheren't the only onces either. One up-side to this ride is that the wait times are always pretty low and the outside plaza always seems to be void of people.

                            The Hogwarts Express isn't just a ride, it also acts as transportation between Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure. You will be required to have a park to park pass in order to ride. They check that at the enternce, so be warned. Me and the other reports have ridden this ride multiple times just for the fun of it, since it's not just a ride between parks, with is a show that happens around you. Also keep in mind that the show has two verisons. When leaving King's Cross Station, the show will be differnt from the show when leaving Hogsmead. Another thing to keep in mind is that your party may be seated with another party. The seating itself will be with a small cabbin, which guests are locked inside of. These shows have no external special effects and you may want to ride multiple times inorder to take in all eatch of the shows have to offer.

                            This ride is the only Harry Potter ride on this side of Universal's parks. This ride will require to ware 3D glasses. This ride takes guests on a tour of Gringotts, which of course goes wroung when Harry Potter and friends are caught breaking in. This leads Belletricks and Voldimort to show up and set the whole tour in chaos. This ride does include some dark spaces, loud noises, and external effects, however they work rather well here. This ride is a wonder mix of both motion simulation and fast moving roller-coaster style rides. And while we don't talk ques all that often, the que for this adventure is awesome! We love seeing the gobblins, the decor, and all the mvoing porttraits! It's definetly alot to take in one your first go, whcih is why we recomden walking through multiple times. Though, do be warned, since it's the only Harry Potter ride in Universtal Studios, it deffetly gets crowded there.

                        The Men in Black is a swirling shooter style ride. In this ride, you go from MIB in training to full MIB agent when a spaceship full of alien criminal cashes onto Earth. In this ride, guests will experince ALOT of spinnig, so definetly hold off on that snack until afterwards. Guests will also earn points when shooting, which leads to a varity of endings, so make sure to shoot everything insight. For one of our reporters, the constant spinning, low-lighting, and some of the loud noises can lead to some uncomfortablness, but it's rather minor. Another of our reporters also said that accutally hitting a target can be tricky, since you have to lind up your lazer blaster with very small and easy to miss spots. These spots are on all of the hittable aliens and can be seen if you known where to look. Once you spot spinning, if you're able to get a good look at an alien, you'll be able to see smooth spots on the aliens' heads and chests. Good luck!
